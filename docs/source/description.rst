.. note:: TLDR: Easy to use Python library for GPX files.

ezGPX is an open source Python library that provides an application programming interface to interact with GPX files. GPS eXchange Format (GPX) is an open file format widely used to share location data. Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) from GPS and accompanying relevant data (such as time or elevation) are arranged in an XML file following a specific schema. Initialy proposed by TopoGraphix in 2002, this schema orders GPS points to create tracks and routes while providing support for metadata and extensions.
